Exactly ✅ You understood it perfectly. Let me lay it out in a clean flow so there’s no confusion:

🔹 Step-by-Step Flow
1. Admin uploads movie + poster (Frontend → Backend)

In React (frontend), Admin fills a form:

Movie Name, Genre, etc.

Uploads Poster (image file).

React sends request → Spring Boot backend (STS).

POST /api/movies/add
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
  name = "Leo"
  genre = "Action"
  file = <poster.jpg>

2. Backend (Spring Boot) handles it

Takes the uploaded file (MultipartFile).

Uploads it to Cloudinary.

Cloudinary returns a public image URL like:

https://res.cloudinary.com/delbuv9wd/image/upload/v1694012345/movie_posters/leo.jpg


Backend saves movie record in DB with:

name = "Leo"

genre = "Action"

poster_url = "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."

3. React fetches movies

React calls:

GET /api/movies


Backend queries DB, gets movie records with poster_url.

Sends response:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Leo",
    "genre": "Action",
    "poster_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/delbuv9wd/image/upload/v1694012345/movie_posters/leo.jpg"
  }
]

4. React displays the movie

React renders:

<img src={movie.poster_url} alt={movie.name} />


➡️ Browser loads the image directly from Cloudinary’s CDN, not from your server.
(This is why Cloudinary is powerful → fast delivery + optimized image hosting.)

✅ Summary in one line

Admin uploads → Backend sends to Cloudinary → Cloudinary gives link → Backend stores link in DB → Frontend fetches link from DB → React <img> shows it.
