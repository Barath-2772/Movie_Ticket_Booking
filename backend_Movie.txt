Yes, this is your Admin Backend. It's designed to let a manager or administrator set up and manage all the core data of your application.

Here are the operations you can currently perform with your API.

City Management
Create a new city: POST /api/cities

Get a list of all cities: GET /api/cities

Get a single city by ID: GET /api/cities/{id}

Update an existing city: PUT /api/cities/{id}

Theater Management
Create a new theater in a city: POST /api/cities/{cityId}/theaters

Get a list of theaters in a city: GET /api/cities/{cityId}/theaters

Delete a theater by its ID: DELETE /api/theaters/{theaterId}

Movie Management
Create a new movie: POST /api/movies

Get a list of all movies: GET /api/movies

Show Management
Create a show (schedule a movie in a theater): POST /api/theaters/{theaterId}/movies/{movieId}/shows

Get shows for a specific movie in a city: GET /api/cities/{cityId}/movies/{movieId}/shows











We use a DTO to create a separation between how our data is stored in the database and how it is shown to the user.

The Restaurant Menu Analogy ðŸ“œ
Think of your @Entity classes (your models) and DTOs as two different documents in a restaurant:

1. The @Entity Model (The Chef's Recipe Book ðŸ““)
The @Entity (e.g., Booking_samp_user) is like the chef's detailed recipe book in the kitchen.

It's complex and contains internal details: secret ingredients (password field), inventory codes (@JoinColumn), and links to other recipes (@OneToMany relationships).

This recipe book should never leave the kitchen.

2. The DTO (The Customer's Menu ðŸ“œ)
The DTO (e.g., ShowDTO) is like the menu you give to the customer in the dining room.

It's simple, clean, and customized for the customer. It only shows what's necessary: the dish name (movieTitle), a simple description (theaterName), and the price.

It hides all the complex kitchen secrets.

Key Reasons to Use DTOs
Security: If we sent our User entity directly to the frontend, it would include the password field. That's a major security risk. A UserDTO allows us to create a "public" version of the user that safely omits the password.

API Stability: You might decide to change your database table by adding a new column to your @Entity. If you send the entity directly, that new field suddenly appears in your API, which could break your frontend. A DTO acts as a stable "contract" with the frontend; you can change the backend entity, but as long as you map it to the same DTO, the API doesn't change.

Customization: Our ShowDTO is the perfect example. The frontend just needs a simple movie title and theater name. But our Show entity has complex, nested Movie and Theater objects. The DTO allows our "Chef" (Service) to prepare a simple, clean package of data that is perfectly shaped for what the "customer" (Frontend) needs to display. This also neatly solves the infinite loop problems.

Show thinking
DTO stands for Data Transfer Object.

It is a simple object whose only purpose is to carry data between different layers of an application, especially between your backend server and the frontend client.

A Simple Analogy: A Shipping Box ðŸ“¦
Think of a DTO as a shipping box.

You use it to bundle up different pieces of information (like a showId, a userId, and a list of seatNumbers) into a single, neat package.

This package is then "shipped" from one part of your system to another (e.g., from the user's request to your Controller).

The box itself doesn't do anything; it's just a container for the items.

Key Characteristics
Carries Data: Its only job is to transfer data.

No Business Logic: It contains no complex logic (like methods to save to a database). It only has fields, getters, and setters.

Separation: It creates a clean separation between your internal database model (Entity) and what you show to the outside world in your API.







so i need an every class to create an dto for the front end ?



Show thinking
Not for every single class, but it is a very good habit and is strongly recommended for most.

Think of it as a rule of thumb.

When to Create a DTO
You should definitely create a DTO when:

You need to hide sensitive data.

Your User entity has a password. You never want to send the password to the frontend. So, you create a UserDTO that leaves out the password field.

You need to prevent infinite loops.

This is the problem we just solved. Your City and Theater entities refer to each other, creating a loop. A DTO breaks this loop by presenting the data in a clean, non-looping structure.

You need to customize the JSON.

Our ShowDTO is a perfect example. The frontend needs a simple movieTitle and theaterName. The Show entity has complex, nested Movie and Theater objects. The DTO allows us to create a simple, flat object that is perfect for the UI.

The "Wall Socket" Analogy ðŸ”Œ
Think of it this way:

Your backend database and Entities are like the complex electrical wiring inside a wall.

Your Frontend is like a simple appliance, such as a lamp.

The DTO is the wall socket.

The wall socket provides a safe, simple, and standard interface for the lamp to get the power it needs, without exposing it to all the complex and dangerous wiring inside. Even if you change the wiring in the wall, your lamp still plugs in the same way.

So, while you might not need a DTO for a very simple entity with no relationships or sensitive data, it's a best practice that makes your application more secure, stable, and easier to maintain.
